<description>This point layer represents subway station stops for the New York City Subway and the Staten Island Railway, managed by MTA New York City Transit. Each point represents a stop location, which is the center of a set of platforms designated to serve specific trains within a subway station. This layer was enhanced by adding a trains field, which lists trains that stop at the station during normal, weekday rush hour service. A structure field indicates whether the station is above or below ground using a number of different categories. The unique ID for the features is stop_id, a field created by the MTA. Some stops that share the same geographic coordinates, because one set of platforms are directly beneath another, were combined into a single stop, and the ID for the second stop was recorded in a field called stop_id2. The geoid field indicates which county the stop is located in using the state-county ANSI FIPS code. This layer was created by the GIS Lab at Baruch College CUNY as part of the NYC Mass Transit Spatial Layer series, to provide access to mass transit features for basic geographic analysis and map making. The data was generated from the MTA's static data developer feeds. It was transformed and generalized from a GTFS format into readily usable GIS features using a series of python scripts.</description>
